    This is just a test.
    I'm trying to find out how fast I can type on the computer.
    I swear it's not I'd do in a normal day, this is so exhausting.
    <p>Oh my God help me, I can't stop myself, I need help goddamnit.</p>

    <b>This is bold, mate</b><br>
    <strong>And this is strong</strong>

    <h1>This is the heading</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Alright, fellas, enough strolling. Now, get up and go watch <a href="https://youtu.be/d_HlPboLRL8"> Runaway</a>
        <b>Aurora</b>
    </h3>
    <p> So this is <b>Aurora</b>, she almost look like a celestial being.
        No, not in this picture. I'm talking about her in real life.
        But if you look closely, she does look like a human.

    So, now we're gonna see an ordered list, it means
    <ol>
        <li>A list</li>
        <li>A list that is in order</li>
        <li>An order that is organized through a list</li>
    </ol>
    And an unordered list means
    <ul>
        <li>An unordered motherfuckin list</li>
        <li>A list that in not in order</li>

    </ul>
